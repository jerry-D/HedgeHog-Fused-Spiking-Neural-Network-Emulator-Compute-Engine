; The SYMPL 64-Bit Universal Floating-point ISA Compute Engine employs a modified Harvard architecture, meaning that it 
; comprises separate program and data memory buses. It has immediate, direct and indirect addressing modes, as well as 
; table read from program memory using direct or indirect addressing mode.  The modified Harvard model can be implemented as
; either a conventional processor or a interleaving, multi-threading processor, wherein said multi-threading threads share the same
; operators, but have their own processor registers (such as PC, SP, Auxiliary Registers, Status Register, etc.) and can
; share some or all the system memory.  This ISA can be easily adapted as a Von Neumann memory model as well.

; This "opcode-less" SYMPL 64-Bit Universal Floating-point ISA Compute EngineA has only seven mnemonics: "_", "P", "N" and "Z", "ACT", "ACC" and "AA",
; which can be used to specify the rounding mode of a given instruction and also to specify the Fused Universal Neural Network (FuNN) activation mode,
; accumulation mode, or activate AND accumulate modes.  

; Instruction bit field definitions common to both direct and indirect addressing modes:

; RM[1:0] Directed Rounding Mode specifier for float results
; mneumonic / 2-bit value
; "_" = 00 = round using current "default" rounding direction, i.e., "nearest". Note: can be changed to "away" by setting bit 54 in the STATUS register 
; "P" = 01 = round towards positive infinity
; "N" = 10 = round towards negative infinity
; "Z" = 11 = round towards zero
; Note: the two RM bits of the instruction can be overridden by setting bit 53 (enable RM attributes) of the STATUS register.  If set, rounding mode attribute bits 51 and 52 of the STATUS register determine rounding direction.
;
; When the FuNN eNNgine or HedgeHog Fused Spiking Neural Network Emulator/Compute Engine is the destination operator, the two RM[1:0] bits become the 
; Activate ("ACT") and Accumulate ("ACC") bits, respectively, when used individually on the assembly line, or "AA" when used together 
;on the assembly line.  When the FuNN eNNgine is the destination the following mnemonics have the follwing meanings:
;
; "_"   = 00 = "default", meaning: perform sum of products with no activation and no accumulation on the tail end of pipeline.
; "ACC" = 01 = ACCumulate mode, meaning:  perform sum of products and ADD the previous sum to arrive an accumulated sum, but with no activation.
; "ACT" = 10 = ACTivate mode, meaning:  perform sum of products with no previous accumulation added to it, then activate using the activation function
;              specified in bits 14 thru 11 in the Status Register (for more information, refer to the .pdf file at this repository with file name,
;              "UFP_ISA.pdf".
; "AA"  = 11 = activate mode and accumulate mode are both simultaneously specified for the instant instruction, thus perform the sum of products computation
;              then ADD the previous sum to it, and then activate it with the previously specified activation function, then accumulate it.
;
; When the FuNN eNNgine is the destination operator, use the directed rounding attribute specifiers in the Status Regester for directed rounding.
;
; DAM[1:0] Data Access Mode pecifies from which memory the operand reads are to take place for the instant instruction
; 00 = both operand A and operand B are read from data memory using either
;      direct or indirect addressing modes
; 01 = operand A is either direct or indirect and operand B is immediate (i.e, immediately available within instant instruction)
; 10 = operand A is read from program memory using direct (table read from program memory) addressing modes 
;      operand B is either direct or indirect and NEVER immediate
; 11 = 32-bit immediate (i.e, immediately available within instant instruction)

; SIGA  Signal for operandA meaning depends on context--either "s" or "_" must immediately precede Size field; can be mixed and matched
;       can mean: "s" = 1 = signed (sign-extended); "_" = 0 = unsigned (zero-extended), depending on target operator
;       can also mean: 1 = text (decimal character sequence); 0 = binary format (mainly used with direct character sequence computations/operators)
;       implementor can make it mean anything he/she wants it to mean, depending on the target operator
; SIGB for operandB meaning depends on context--either "s" or "_" must immediately precede Size field; can be mixed and matched
;       can mean: "s" = 1 = signed (sign-extended); "_" = 0 = unsigned (zero-extended), depending on target operator
;       can also mean: 1 = text (decimal character sequence); 0 = binary format (mainly used with direct character sequence computations/operators)
;       implementor can make it mean anything he/she wants it to mean, depending on the target operator
; SIGD for DEST meaning depends on context--either "s" or "_" must immediately precede Size field; can be mixed and matched
;       can mean: "s" = 1 = signed (sign-extended) results; "_" = 0 = unsigned (zero-extended), depending on target operator
;       can mean: 1 = eXchange ends (ie, flip endian-ness) on and during read of operand A, depending on context, for example, reading/writing from/to external memory versus on-chip memory
;       can also mean: 1 = store results as text (decimal character sequence); 0 = binary format 
;       can also mean: restore selected operator with value and flags being written
;       implementor can make it mean anything he/she wants it to mean, depending on the target operator
;
; SIZ[2:0] Size in bytes, of source/destination (shown with SIGn bit cleared, i.e., immediately preceded with "_" character).
; "_1:"   = 0 000 = 1 byte
; "_2:"   = 0 001 = 2 bytes (half-word)
; "_4:"   = 0 010 = 4 bytes (word)
; "_8:"   = 0 011 = 8 bytes (double-word)
; "_16:"  = 0 100 = 16 bytes (gob)--i.e, vector, structure and/or mix of types up to this byte count
; "_32:"  = 0 101 = 32 bytes (gob)
; "_64:"  = 0 110 = 64 bytes (gob)
; "_128:" = 0 111 = 128 bytes (gob)

; "s64:"  = 1 110 = 64 bytes (gob)
; "s128:" = 1 111 = 128 bytes (gob)

; IND 1 = indirect addressing mode for that field; 0 = direct addressing mode for that field
;
; IMOD is only used with IND = 1, meaning it is only used with indirect addressing mode for a given field
; IMOD = 1 means: use signed AMOUNT field + ARn contents for effective address; ARn is not modified
;
;          for example,   _    _4:shft.0 = (_4:*AR2[32], RIGHT, 3)
;                         _    _8:shft.0 = (_8:*AR1[-24], RIGHT, 3)

; IMOD = 0 means: use ARn contents as pointer for read or write. Then automatically post-modify the contents
;          of ARn by adding or subtracting UNsigned AMOUNT field to/from it.
;           
;          for exampl,    _    _4:shft.0 = (_4:*AR2++[8], RIGHT, 3)
;                         _    _4:shft.1 = (_4:*AR1--[4], LEFT, 6)
